This is my second year in college. The college experience has not been all that I have _dreamed_ it would be. Growing up I have heard from many people that college was the best time of their lives. Personally I believe the best time of my life was when I was in elementary school because I had nothing to worry about. Now that I am in college I have a lot to be concerend about. I have learned that you want what you dont have. When you are a kid you want to be an adult but when you become and adult you want to be a kid. When you have a girlfriend you want to be single, but when you are single you wish you had a girlfriend. I hope someday being an adult will be fun.</p>

<p> I spent **hours** trying to learn how to do this. After all the youtube videos and google searches I still cant figure out how to create multiple pages and link them together on my README page. Please dont give me a zero, I cannot drop this class. Thank you for your understanding and time. </p>
