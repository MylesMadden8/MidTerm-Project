This is my second year in college. I wanted to do something with computers because they interest me more than any other subject of school. My interest in programmin g has rapidly declined recently. While trying to complete this assignment I spent hours watching youtube videos trying to learn about Github. I still dont know how to create multiple pages or how to link these pages together. i am extremely confused and figured that if I cant even figure this out I should be learning about information technology. I still am trying to complete as much as I can because I dont want a zero for the first project.</p>
